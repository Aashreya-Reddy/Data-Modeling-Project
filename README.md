# Data-Modeling-Project

Predicted credit card fraud using appropriate evaluation metric F2 score and a supervised learning model; used a support vector
machine with hyperparameter tuning to attain a score of 91%. Performed cleaning and preprocessing of the data using Python.

List of models that I've tried: 

Logistic Regression
Decision Tree
Support Vector Machine 

Random Forest

Extra Trees

Gradient Boosting

Decision Trees

XGBoost

Bagging decision tree with under sampling

k-Nearest Neighbors

Easy Ensemble Classifier

Neural Network (scikit learn MLPClassifier)
